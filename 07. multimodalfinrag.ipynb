2008 , revenues in the credit union systems and services business segment increased 14% ( 14 % ) from fiscal 2007 . all revenue components within the segment experienced growth during fiscal 2008 . license revenue generated the largest dollar growth in revenue as episys ae , our flagship core processing system aimed at larger credit unions , experienced strong sales throughout the year . support and service revenue , which is the largest component of total revenues for the credit union segment , experienced 34 percent growth in eft support and 10 percent growth in in-house support . gross profit in this business segment increased $ 9344 in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 , due primarily to the increase in license revenue , which carries the highest margins . liquidity and capital resources we have historically generated positive cash flow from operations and have generally used funds generated from operations and short-term borrowings on our revolving credit facility to meet capital requirements . we expect this trend to continue in the future . the company 2019s cash and cash equivalents increased to $ 118251 at june 30 , 2009 from $ 65565 at june 30 , 2008 . the

provided by operations increased $ 25587 to $ 206588 for the fiscal year ended june 30 , 2009 as compared to $ 181001 for the fiscal year ended june 30 , 2008 . this increase is primarily attributable to a decrease in receivables compared to the same period a year ago of $ 21214 . this decrease is largely the result of fiscal 2010 annual software maintenance billings being provided to customers earlier than in the prior year , which allowed more cash to be collected before the end of the fiscal year than in previous years . further , we collected more cash overall related to revenues that will be recognized in subsequent periods in the current year than in fiscal 2008 . cash used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended june 2009 was $ 59227 and includes $ 3027 in contingent consideration paid on prior years 2019 acquisitions . cash used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended june 2008 was $ 102148 and includes payments for acquisitions of $ 48109 , plus $ 1215

stock for $ 58405 , the payment of dividends of $ 26903 and $ 13489 net repayment on our revolving credit facilities . cash used in financing activities was partially offset by proceeds of $ 3773 from the exercise of stock options and the sale of common stock ( through the employee stock purchase plan ) and $ 348 excess tax benefits from stock option exercises . during fiscal 2008 , net cash used in financing activities for the fiscal year was $ 101905 and includes the repurchase of 4200 shares of our common stock for $ 100996 , the payment of dividends of $ 24683 and $ 429 net repayment on our revolving credit facilities . cash used in financing activities was partially offset by proceeds of $ 20394 from the exercise of stock options and the sale of common stock and $ 3809 excess tax benefits from stock option exercises . beginning during fiscal 2008 , us financial markets and many of the largest us financial institutions have been shaken by negative developments in the home mortgage industry and the mortgage markets , and particularly the markets for subprime mortgage-backed securities . since that time , these and other such developments have resulted in a broad , global economic downturn . while we , as is the case with most companies , have experienced the effects of this downturn , we have not experienced any significant issues with our current collection efforts , and we believe that any future impact to our liquidity will be minimized by cash generated by recurring sources of revenue and due to our access to available lines of credit.

The data is structured into four rows, each representing a different financial metric, and four columns, one for each fiscal year. \\n\\n1. **Net Sales**: This row indicates the total sales revenue generated by the company. In 2000, the net sales were $7,983 million, which decreased to $5,363 million in 2001, representing a significant reduction. The sales increased slightly to $5,742 million in 2002.\\n   \\n2. **Cost of Sales**: This row reflects the costs directly associated with the production of the goods sold by the company. The cost increased marginally from $5,817 million in 2000 to $4,128 million in 2001, and then again to $4,139 million in 2002. The data shows a relatively stable cost of sales compared to the variation in net sales.\\n\\n3. **Gross Margin**: This line refers to the difference between net sales and cost of sales, which indicates the profitability from sales after accounting for costs.

The data is structured into four rows, each representing a different financial metric, and four columns, one for each fiscal year. \\n\\n1. **Net Sales**: This row indicates the total sales revenue generated by the company. In 2000, the net sales were $7,983 million, which decreased to $5,363 million in 2001, representing a significant reduction. The sales increased slightly to $5,742 million in 2002.\\n   \\n2. **Cost of Sales**: This row reflects the costs directly associated with the production of the goods sold by the company. The cost increased marginally from $5,817 million in 2000 to $4,128 million in 2001, and then again to $4,139 million in 2002. The data shows a relatively stable cost of sales compared to the variation in net sales.\\n\\n3. **Gross Margin**: This line refers to the difference between net sales and cost of sales, which indicates the profitability from sales after accounting for costs. The gross margin was highest in 2000 at $2,166 million but dropped to $1,235 million in 2001 and then recovered to $1,603 million in 2002, indicating fluctuations in profitability over these years.\\n\\n4. **Gross Margin Percentage**: This row presents gross margin as a percentage of net sales, highlighting the company\\'s ability to retain earnings after costs.

[2] estimated life , annuity and disability obligations include death and disability claims , policy surrenders , policyholder dividends and trail commissions offset by expected future deposits and premiums on in-force contracts . estimated contractual policyholder obligations are based on mortality , morbidity and lapse assumptions comparable with life 2019s historical experience , modified for recent observed trends . life has also assumed market growth and interest crediting consistent with assumptions used in amortizing deferred acquisition costs . in contrast to this table , the majority of life 2019s obligations are recorded on the balance sheet at the current account value , as described in critical accounting estimates , and do not incorporate an expectation of future market growth , interest crediting , or future deposits . therefore , the estimated contractual policyholder obligations presented in this table significantly exceed the liabilities recorded in reserve for future policy benefits and unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses , other policyholder funds and benefits payable and separate account liabilities . due to the significance of the assumptions used , the amounts presented could materially differ from actual results . as separate account obligations are legally insulated from general account obligations , the separate account obligations will be fully funded by cash flows from separate account assets . life expects to fully fund the general account obligations from cash flows from general account investments and future deposits and premiums . [3] includes contractual principal and interest payments . payments exclude amounts associated with fair-value hedges of certain of the company 2019s long-term debt . all long-term debt obligations have fixed rates of interest . long-term debt obligations also includes principal and interest payments of $ 700 and $ 2.4 billion , respectively , related to junior subordinated debentures which are callable beginning in 2006 . see note 14 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of long-term debt obligations . [4] includes $ 1.4 billion in commitments to purchase investments including $ 330 of limited partnerships and $ 299 of mortgage loans . outstanding commitments under these limited partnerships and mortgage loans are included in payments due in less than 1 year since the timing of funding these commitments cannot be estimated . the remaining $ 759 relates to payables for securities purchased which are reflected on the company 2019s consolidated balance sheet . [5] includes estimated contribution of $ 200 to the company 2019s pension plan in 2005 . [6] as of december 31 , 2004 , the company has accepted cash collateral of $ 1.6 billion in connection with the company 2019s securities lending program and derivative instruments . since the timing of the return of the collateral is uncertain , the return of the collateral has been included in the payments due in less than 1 year . [7] includes $ 52 in collateralized loan obligations ( 201cclos 201d ) issued to third-party investors by a consolidated investment management entity sponsored by the company in connection with synthetic clo transactions . the clo investors have no recourse to the company 2019s assets other than the dedicated assets collateralizing the clos . refer to note 4 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of .\\n\\nQuestion: what portion of total obligations are due within the next 3 years?\\nAnswer: 22.99%\\nExecution Answer: 0.22986\\n\\nDialogue Break: ['what is the value of obligations due within 1 year?', 'what is the amount due between 1-3 years?', 'what is the sum?', 'what is the sum divided by total obligations due?']\\n\\n### Comprehensive Description of the Table\\n\\nThe table outlines the aggregate contractual obligations of a company as of 2019, categorized by different types of liabilities and segmented by payment due periods.

certain employees , including our executives and vesting will occur annually upon the completion of a service period or our meeting established financial performance criteria . annual vesting occurs at rates ranging from 15% ( 15 % ) to 35% ( 35 % ) once performance criteria are reached . a summary of our restricted stock as of december 31 , 2013 , 2012 and 2011 and charges during the years then ended are presented below: .\\n\\n | 2013 | 2012 | 2011\\nbalance at beginning of year | 2804901 | 2912456 | 2728290\\ngranted | 192563 | 92729 | 185333\\ncancelled | -3267 ( 3267 ) | -200284 ( 200284

17386949 $ 7023942 $ 21768084 the fair value of restricted stock that vested during the years ended december 31 , 2013 , 2012 and 2011 was $ 1.6 million , $ 22.4 million and $ 4.3 million , respectively . as of december 31 , 2013 , there was $ 17.8 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock , which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 2.7 years . for the years ended december 31 , 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , approximately $ 4.5 million , $ 4.1 million and $ 3.4 million , respectively , was capitalized to assets associated with compensation expense related to our long-term compensation plans , restricted stock and stock options . we granted ltip units , which include bonus , time-based and performance based awards , with a fair value of $ 27.1 million , zero and $ 8.5 million as of 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively . the grant date fair value of the ltip unit awards was calculated in accordance with asc 718 . a third party consultant determined the fair value of the ltip units to have a discount from sl green's common stock price . the discount was calculated by considering the inherent uncertainty that the ltip units will reach parity with other common partnership units and the illiquidity due to transfer restrictions . as of december 31 , 2013 , there was $ 5.0 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to the time-based and performance based awards , which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 1.5 years . during the years ended december 31 , 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , we recorded compensation expense related to bonus , time-based and performance based awards of approximately $ 27.3 million , $ 12.6 million and $ 8.5 million , respectively . 2010 notional unit long-term compensation plan in december 2009 , the compensation committee of the company's board of directors approved the general terms of the sl green realty corp . 2010 notional unit long-term compensation program , or the 2010 long-term compensation plan . the 2010 long-term compensation plan is a long-term incentive compensation plan pursuant to which award recipients could earn , in the aggregate , from approximately $ 15.0 million up to approximately $ 75.0 million of ltip units in the operating partnership based on our stock price appreciation over three years beginning on december 1 , 2009 ; provided that , if maximum performance had been achieved , approximately $ 25.0 million of awards could be earned at any time after the beginning of the second year and an additional approximately $ 25.0 million of awards could be earned at any time after the beginning of the third year . in order to achieve maximum performance under the 2010 long-term compensation plan , our aggregate stock price appreciation during the performance period had to equal or exceed 50% ( 50 % ) . the compensation committee determined that maximum performance had been achieved at or shortly after the beginning of each of the second and third years of the performance period and for the full performance period and , accordingly , 366815 ltip units , 385583 ltip units and 327416 ltip units were earned under the 2010 long-term compensation plan in december 2010 , 2011 and 2012 , respectively . substantially in accordance with the original terms of the program , 50% ( 50 % ) of these ltip units vested on december 17 , 2012 ( accelerated from the original january 1 , 2013 vesting date ) , 25% ( 25 % ) of these ltip units vested on december 11 , 2013 ( accelerated from the original january 1 , 2014 vesting date ) and the remainder is scheduled to vest on january 1 , 2015 based on .\\n\\nQuestion: for the years ended december 31 , 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , what was the total in millions capitalized to assets associated with compensation expense related to long-term compensation plans , restricted stock and stock options?\\\\\\\\n\\nAnswer: 12\\nExecution Answer: 12.0\\n\\nDialogue Break: ['what was the total, in millions, capitalized to assets associated with compensation expense related to long-term compensation plans , restricted stock and stock options in the year of 2013?', 'and what was it in 2012, also in millions?', 'what was, then, in millions, the total sum that was capitalized in those two years?', 'including the year of 2011, what would then be the total sum capitalized in the three years, in millions?']\\n\\n### Description of the Table\\n\\nThe table summarizes information about restricted stock for the years ending December 31 for 2013, 2012, and 2011. It provides key metrics in each of those years, which include:\\n\\n1. **Balance at Beginning of Year**: This indicates the number of restricted stock units available at the start of each year.\\n2. **Granted**: This column reflects the number of restricted stock units that were granted during the respective years.\\n3. **Cancelled**: This shows the number of restricted stock units that were canceled. It includes the magnitude of the cancellation along with the absolute numbers in parentheses for clarity.\\n4. **Balance at End of Year**: This represents the total number of restricted stock units that were still available at the end of each year after accounting for grants and cancellations.\\n5. **Vested During the Year**: This metric indicates how many restricted stock units vested during the respective years.\\n6. **Compensation Expense Recorded**: This column lists the recorded compensation expense associated with the restricted stock for each year in dollar terms.\\n7. **Weighted Average Fair Value of Restricted Stock Granted During the Year**: This provides the fair value of the restricted stock granted in each year, which is useful for evaluating the cost of compensation associated with the stock.\\n\\nThe values in the table demonstrate the changes in the stock dynamics year-over-year, including fluctuations in the number of units, expense recognition, and valuation of stock grants.\\n\\n### Table in Markdown Format\\n\\n```markdown\\n|                      | 2013      | 2012      | 2011      |\\n|----------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\\n| Balance at Beginning of Year     | 2,804,901 | 2,912,456 | 2,728,290 |\\n| Granted              | 192,563   | 92,729    | 185,333   |\\n| Cancelled            | -3,267    | -200,284  | -1,167    |\\n| Balance at End of Year          | 2,994,197 | 2,804,901 | 2,912,456 |\\n| Vested During the Year          | 21,074    | 408,800   | 66,299    |\\n| Compensation Expense Recorded    | $6,713,155 | $6,930,381 | $17,365,401 |\\n| Weighted Average Fair Value of Restricted Stock Granted During the Year | $17,386,949 | $7,023,942  | $21,768,084 |\\n``` \\n\\nThis markdown representation maintains the structure and readability of the original table while adhering to markdown formatting conventions.\")]"
