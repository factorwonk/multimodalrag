fiscal 2007 . all revenue components within the segment experienced growth during fiscal 2008 . license revenue generated the largest dollar growth in revenue as episys ae , our flagship core processing system aimed at larger credit unions , experienced strong sales throughout the year . support and service revenue , which is the largest component of total revenues for the credit union segment , experienced 34 percent growth in eft support and 10 percent growth in in-house support . gross profit in this business segment increased $ 9344 in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 , due primarily to the increase in license revenue , which carries the highest margins . liquidity and capital resources we have historically generated positive cash flow from operations and have generally used funds generated from operations and short-term borrowings on our revolving credit facility to meet capital requirements . we expect this trend to continue in the future . the company 2019s cash

as compared to $ 181001 for the fiscal year ended june 30 , 2008 . this increase is primarily attributable to a decrease in receivables compared to the same period a year ago of $ 21214 . this decrease is largely the result of fiscal 2010 annual software maintenance billings being provided to customers earlier than in the prior year , which allowed more cash to be collected before the end of the fiscal year than in previous years . further , we collected more cash overall related to revenues that will be recognized in subsequent periods in the current year than in fiscal 2008 . cash

the employee stock purchase plan ) and $ 348 excess tax benefits from stock option exercises . during fiscal 2008 , net cash used in financing activities for the fiscal year was $ 101905 and includes the repurchase of 4200 shares of our common stock for $ 100996 , the payment of dividends of $ 24683 and $ 429 net repayment on our revolving credit facilities . cash used in financing activities was partially offset by proceeds of $ 20394 from the exercise of stock options and the sale of common stock and $ 3809 excess tax benefits from stock option exercises . beginning during fiscal 2008 , us financial markets and many of the largest us financial institutions have been shaken by negative developments in the home mortgage industry and the mortgage markets , and particularly the markets for subprime mortgage-backed securities . since that time , these and other such developments have resulted in a broad , global economic downturn . while we , as is the case with most companies , have experienced the effects of this downturn , we have not experienced any significant issues with our current collection efforts , and we believe that any future impact to our liquidity will be minimized by cash generated by recurring sources of revenue and due to our access to available lines of credit. .\\n\\nQuestion: what was the percentage change in the net cash from operating activities from

It focuses on the company's net sales, cost of sales, gross margin, and gross margin percentage for each of those years. \\n\\n1. **Net Sales**: This row shows the total revenue generated by the company from sales of its products. In 2000, net sales were $7,983 million, which decreased to $5,363 million in 2001—a significant drop of approximately 32%. However, there was a slight recovery in 2002, with net sales increasing to $5,742 million.\\n\\n2. **Cost of Sales**: This row lists the total expenses directly associated with the production of goods sold. The costs remained relatively stable from 2000 to 2001, changing from $5,817 million in 2000 to $4,128 million in 2001. In 2002, the cost slightly increased to $4,139 million.\\n\\n3. **Gross Margin**: This row indicates the gross profit of the company calculated as net sales minus the cost of sales. In 2000, the gross margin was $2,166 million, but it fell to $1,235 million in 2001 due to decreased net sales. The gross margin improved in 2002 to $1,603 million, reflecting an increase in net sales while costs remained relatively stable.\\n\\n4. **Gross Margin Percentage**: This row provides the gross margin as a percentage of net sales, offering insights into profitability relative to sales. The gross margin percentage decreased from 27% in 2000 to 23% in 2001, indicating declining profitability. In 2002, the gross margin percentage rebounded to 28%, a sign of improved operational efficiency and possibly better pricing strategies.\\n\\nOverall, the table encapsulates key financial aspects pertinent to understanding the company’s performance over the specified periods, highlighting the challenges and recoveries seen in net sales and profitability.\\n\\n### Table in Markdown Format\\n\\n```markdown\\n|                 |  2002   |  2001   |  2000   |\\n|-----------------|---------|---------|---------|\\n| Net Sales       | $ 5742  | $ 5363  | $ 7983  |\\n| Cost of Sales   | $ 4139  | $ 4128  | $ 5817  |\\n| Gross Margin     | $ 1603  | $ 1235  | $ 2166  |\\n| Gross Margin %  | 28%     | 23%     | 27%     |\\n```\\n\\nThis markdown format maintains the structure and clarity of the original table, allowing it to be easily rendered in various platforms that support markdown syntax.\", 'qa': {'question': 'what was the percentage change in net sales from 2000 to 2001?', 'answer': '-32%', 'explanation': '', 'ann_table_rows': [1], 'ann_text_rows': [], 'steps': [{'op': 'minus1-1', 'arg1': '5363', 'arg2': '7983', 'res': '-2620'}, {'op': 'divide1-2', 'arg1': '#0', 'arg2': '7983', 'res': '-32%'}], 'program': 'subtract(5363, 7983), divide(#0, 7983)', 'gold_inds': {'table_1': 'the net sales of 2002 is $ 5742 ;

as compared to $ 181001 for the fiscal year ended june 30 , 2008 . this increase is primarily attributable to a decrease in receivables compared to the same period a year ago of $ 21214 . this decrease is largely the result of fiscal 2010 annual software maintenance billings being provided to customers earlier than in the prior year , which allowed more cash to be collected before the end

partially offset by proceeds of $ 20394 from the exercise of stock options and the sale of common stock and $ 3809 excess tax benefits from stock option exercises . beginning during fiscal 2008 , us financial markets and many of the largest us financial institutions have been shaken by negative developments in the home mortgage industry and the mortgage markets , and particularly the markets for subprime mortgage-backed securities . since that time , these and other such developments have resulted in a broad , global economic downturn . while we , as is the case with most companies , have experienced the effects of this downturn , we have not experienced any significant issues with our current collection efforts , and we believe that any future impact to our liquidity will be minimized by cash generated by recurring sources of revenue and due to our access to available lines of credit. .\\n\\nQuestion: what was the percentage change in the net cash from operating activities from
